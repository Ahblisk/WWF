Later on, Kay and his family packed up and moved to New York where he finished high school and eventually joined the United States Air Force. While in the Air Force Kay was introduced to computers for the first time. After his first encounter Kay signed up to take a test to become a programmer for one of the earliest computers an IBM 1401. Needless to say, Kay passed the test. After finishing in the Air Force, Alan Kay went back to school. He decided to attend the University of Utah.
