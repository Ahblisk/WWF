  This source talks about Alan Kay's life and his beginnings in the Computing world. The source goes through his entire early years with computing and his ideas and thought process. It talks about how Kay got the idea of object-oriented programming languages. Then proceeds with his experience with college and meeting Dave Evans. The source talks about the effect Evans had on Kay and his impact on his life. Then it talks about how Kay finally graduated and started research on laptops for children. Then it goes into his effect after being hired at XEROX PARC. Then it talks about his many innovations such as, Graphical Interfaces, SmallTalk (A programming language), The first Dynabook's, and The NoteTaker. S. B. Barnes chapter is credible because she got in contact with Alan Kay himself and he helped complete the research. This source will be used to present facts about Kay and his work. The source provides a credible and well-organized biography on Alan Kay.

  This source explains a Graphical User Interface, or a GUI, and how it works. GUI’s main concept was to give the user the ability to communicate using different methods. Symbols, visual methods, and pointing devices were all part of the original list of methods. GUI’s were not created by only one person and are todays standard. Then it goes into detail on the impact the GUI had on Apple’s engineers. Leading them to improve the concept and add it to their own two computers Lisa and Macintosh. Then it talks about the evolution of the GUI through the nineties and its use in internet software. The source opens up about Speech Recognition and its attempt to replace GUI’s. Speech Recognitions progress opened up more gates for different personal appliances. The source gives lots of interesting information and helps make great quiz questions. The source is very informative on how Alan Kay’s work on the Graphical User Interface changed the work flow of society.

  This source first starts with the history of object-oriented programming. Mentioning the turing maching and lambda calculus. Talking about how those two things are early forms of universal computation. Then explains how the invention of Sketchpad inspired the idea of object-oriented programming. The first language perceived as object oriented was Simula. Simula was designed and developed by Kristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl. Alan Kay originally came up with the term “object-oriented” while he was in school. The source then goes on to talk about the nature of object-oriented programming and how its sole purpose was passing messages. The source provides examples of the application of object-oriented programming in javascript. Then helps define what an “object” exactly is. An object is a data-structure used to pass messages. Then the source talks about how modern-day object-oriented programming is not like the original programming. This source is very informative on how object-oriented programming has changed into modern day.

  This video source Carrie Anne explains in even simpler terms on how object-oriented programming works. She give’s an example of abstraction and how that plays a role in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). The example was of a Car, and its functioning parts that make it a Car. The Car is an object, and all of its components are also objects. This leads to a hierarchy listing and makes it possible to allow teams of people to work on something without bothering each other. She goes on to talk about IDE’s (Integrated Development Environment) and how useful they are for programmers. She talks about the importance of documentation. Object-oriented programming paves way for large groups of people to work on large amounts of code without many issues. The creation of OOP has accelerated the progress of software engineering and has help programmers make great leaps and bounds towards a better, and faster future.

  In this source Kay talks about his mentor, David Evans. Evans apparently had a profound effect on Kay’s life by teaching him about people. Kay praises Evans highly in this source. Kay then talks about his 4th and 6th grade teacher, Mary Quirk, and her way teaching that helped him later on in life. Kay talks about how thankful he is of his past teachers, and how much of an impact they had on him. He thinks teaching is the best possible way to inspire young kids and help them make changes in the world. He talks about true teachers realize that process of learning is something that only takes place inside the learner. This source is an informative video on the way Alan Kay thinks. Of how he initially gained his intuition for a research-based mindset. This source will help with the about section on my website and improve the quality of it.
