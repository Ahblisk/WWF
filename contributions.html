    <p>One of the first programming languages Alan Kay helped create was called SmallTalk. SmallTalk is an Object-Oriented programming language designed specifically for educational purposes. It was used to help students learn the new idea of programming and help them get used to the different way of thinking that came with Object-Oriented languages. SmallTalk lead to many popular languages that are used today including Ruby, Java, and Python. Object-Oriented Programming opened doors to hundreds of different innovations for the computing world. One of these innovations was Graphical User Interfaces or GUI's. A Graphical User Interface is what the user of a computer see's and interacts with. The different symbols, buttons, drop down boxes, links and other things all are apart of the GUI. When Graphical User Interfaces were first implemented into computers they changed the industry entirely. Leaving many older systems unable to compete with the newer models being released from Apple and Microsoft.</p>
